# TA-Web-Application
A web application includes the front end (using HTML/JavaScript/CSS), back-end (ASP Net Core, C#, MVC), and an incorporated database (SQL/AWS))

Please run it in Visual Studio. There are three types of roles, and they have different access authorities. 
Log in with username (admin@utah.edu) and password(123ABC!@#def) for admin access. The Administrator has a link to the Users/Roles admin page, which can edit users' roles, while others do not. In addition, the admin can access the Chart Page, which shows the courses' enrollment number through a timeline; it can also go to the applicant list page and course page with full access.
Only students can create and edit an application and availability slots. For student role login, feel free to create your own account or login using your Google account. 
Professor roles have limited access.
